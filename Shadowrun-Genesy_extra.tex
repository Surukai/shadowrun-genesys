\chapter{New Archetypes}
The new archetypes here are based on the meta-variants, metasapients and others found in \textbf{Run Faster} for Shadowrun 5th edition or \textbf{Runner's Companion} (Shadowrun 4). Some updates of abilities are taken from Shadowrun 6th edition like Vampire being vulnerable to wood instead of silver.

\section{Metasapients}

\section{Shapeshifters}
\label{sec:shapeshifters}\index{Shapeshifter}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Shapeshifters are awakened animals that can shift into a human form. They are animals and return to their natural form if killed or knocked unconscious. 

Common for all shapeshifters is their ability to regenerate from wounds and a vulnerability to silver. Other abilities granted from their animal side are generally only active while in their natural form. Some abilities like low-light vision can be used in their human for as well.

Gear and carried items do not transform and like other non-metahumans they can not benefit from cyberware or bioware. At the GM's discretion some highly specialized deltaware implants could work while they are in human form but operating on a creature that regenerates is at least daunting (\DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie).

Lacking education means they have a harder time mastering skills but some talents can reduce this.

All shapeshifters are awakened and cannot become technomancers.


\begin{description}
	\item[Regeneration]\index{Regeneration} At the start of every turn during structured encounters roll an Average (\DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie) \emph{Resilience} check; recover 1 Wound for every net \Success\ and 1 strain per \Advantage. A \Triumph\ recovers 1 critical, starting with the lowest severity. Only wounds suffered from attacks or getting hurt regenerate this way. Strain or wounds from activating abilities, fear or social skills do not regenerate.
	\item[Vulnerability: Silver] Shapeshifters are vulnerable to silver and cannot regenerate wounds or strain caused by silver weapons. See the weapon entry on page \pageref{silver} for more information.
	\item[Shift]\index{Shift} As an Action, the shapeshifter can shift between their animal and human form. While in animal form they gain +1 Brawn and +1 Agility or +1 Agility and the ability to fly if their animal form is capable of flying.
	\item[Uneducated] \label{uneducated} After character creation, Shapeshifters pay XP for raising skills as if they all were non-career skills. Upgrade the difficulty when dealing with technology (or at the GM's discretion) unless the character has skill ranks in the relevant skill.

\section{Infected}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/piqsels.com-id-znuch}
\end{center}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Infected, suffering from the various strains of the HMHVV, Human-metahuman-vampiric-virus. Despite being metahumans, infected characters generally can't benefit from cyberware or bioware and if infected during play their bodies will reject most implants, often killing the subject in the process. 

\subsection{Becoming infected}
\label{sec:gettinginfected}
Becoming infected reduces the character's \textit{Essence} by one. Some characteristics increase and others might decrease but as a general rule, succumbing to the hunger and lifestyle required to live as infected is not compatible with most gaming groups and should a character become infected during play they will turn into an NPC and possibly a monster.

At the GM's discretion a solution to change the character's archetype into their infected variant, applying a suitable XP tax to make up the difference. We suggest a xp cost of around 100xp or more depending on the new archetype gained. 

A lot of the infected archetypes below require \textbf{Prime runner} to be viable and will be marked when applicable. 

\subsection{Essence loss}
\label{sec:essenseloss}
Infected need to feed on metahuman flesh or blood to stay alive. Every month of in game time they lose one point of Essence. Some infected powers also cost essence to use. 

 \subsection{Allergy: Sunlight}
 \label{allergysunlight}
 Many infected are vulnerable or allergic to sunlight. For some it is merely a strong discomfort (illustrated with \SetbackDie \SetbackDie) while others take damage. 
 
\begin{description}
	\item[Mild] Mild allergy adds \SetbackDie \SetbackDie 
	\item[Moderate] A moderate allergy means the infected no longer gets a free maneuver every turn in addition to the above effects.
	\item[Severe] Infected with severe allergy to sunlight takes 2 wound every round in structured encounters or every minute of narrative play. In addition they become staggered whenever in direct sunlight, all in addition to the above effects.

\chapter{New Talents}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\section{Tier 1}
\Talent{Rapid shift}{1}{Maneuver}{No} Can use the Shift power as a Maneuver instead of Action.



\section{Tier 2}

\Talent{Metahuman education}{2}{Passive}{Yes} When this talent is selected select 1 career skill. That skill no longer suffer the penalty from \textit{Uneducated} and now cost like a normal career skill to improve. Additional ranks in this talent adds two more career skills to be selected.

\section{Tier 3}
\Talent{Daywalker}{3}{Passive}{No} WIP. Penalty reduction for sunlight.

\section{Tier 4}
\Talent{Banshee scream}{4}{Action}{No} Can only be taken by \textit{Banshee} characters. Once per encounter, make a Hard (\DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie) \textbf{Coercion} check. Success means all targets within medium range becomes disoriented until the end of next round. One target per uncanceled \Success\ becomes ensnared, and \Threat\ can be spent to ensnare one ally per uncanceled \Threat. \Triumph\ can be used to instead stagger a target. \Despair\ can be spent to stagger allies or reduce the Banshee's essence (See \pageref{sec:essenceloss}).

\section{Tier 5}
\Talent{Mist Form}{5}{Action}{No} Can only be taken by Vampire or Banshee characters. Mist form allows your character to transform into a cloud of mist until the end of the encounter or about 5 minutes of narrative play. While in mist form all damage is reduce by 10 (to a minimum of 1) after soak is applied. 

Use of Mist form reduces the characters essence by one. Basic clothing and magical foci transform with your character but other weapons and items generally do not.

\chapter{New Gear}
\section{Weapon mods and ammunition}
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\subsection{Silver bullets}\label{silver}\index{Silver bullets}
	Bullets with silver jacket or made from alloys with high enough silver content to work against creatures vulnerable to silver such as shapeshifters. The lower density of the bullet reduces the effectiveness against regular targets. Silver bullets are only effective in weapons that fire bullets.
	
	\subsection{Injection darts}
	Injection darts can be used to deliver injection based toxins or drugs. WIP
	
	\subsection{Seven-7}
	Target must make an immediate Daunting (\DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie) Resillience check or suffer 10 wounds and become \textit{Staggered} for 3 rounds. \Advantage\ can be used to reduce the damage and duration of the stagger and replace with with Disorientation instead. 
	
	Seven-7 is both a contact and gas based neurotoxin and while respiratory protection works at a distance, targets directly hit with Seven-7 suffers the effects unless they are completely protected.
	
	\subsection{Dragon's breath shells}
	Dragons breath turns a shotgun into a makeshift flamethrower. The shell fires a concentrated stream of fire up to short range. Using dragon's breath shells temporarily removes blast and knockdown from the base weapon.

\section{House rules}
\begin{multicols}{2} Below follows some changes and additions that are probably less general and more suited for \textbf{Surukai's} gaming group but feel free to use any or all of them.

\subsection{Spending Advantage and Threat}
While not explicitly stated, unless otherwise noted each entry can only be bought once. For example recovering strain or giving out \BoostDie\ can only be done once. 

\subsection{Cyberware, augmentation, condition and talent stacking}
Not a house rule per se but a clarification. Not all augmentations stack with each other. For example Bone lacing and Bone Density or multiple abilities that modify the character's skin (Troll natural armor and Othoskin). 

Common sense applies to conditions as well. A target can only be knocked down once but can have multiple instances of burning.

%Augmentations do not always stack and getting the same bonus from multiple sources do not always stack. Examples include getting +Soak from both talents and cyberware or taking multiple talents or cyberware or magic to add damage to attacks or maneuvers. 

%A general rule of thumb is that limited use bonuses gained from for example attacking unaware targets, spending story points or only occuring when a narrow condition is met generally works together with talents, magic or cyberware that provides a bonus as long as they don't trigger on the same condition or add damage based on ranks in a skill  more than once.

%\textit{Example} Armor Master Talent adds +1 Soak and Electrical Insulation adds +2 Soak but only against Electrical attack, this stacks. Orthoskin cyberware does not stack with Troll thick hide or Enduring (Tier 4) talent. 

%\textit{Example 2} Damage from backstab works with Feral Strength but Street Fighter adding damage per rank in Skullduggery does not stack with Pressure Point adding damage per rank in Medicine since adding damage from ranks in a skill is already done.

\subsection{Changed talents}
\Talent{Power of Darkness (alternate)}{5}{Maneuver}{No} Once per session, take the Power of Darkness maneuver to make you and all allies within medium range recover two wound and one strain for every Story Point missing from the Player pool. %TODO wording and keywords

\Talent{Enduring}{4}{Passive}{No} Enduring increases your character's soak by 1 as long as your essence is 6.

\Talent{Deadly Accuracy}{4}{Passive}{Yes} What? No... there are too many +damage per ranks in skill talents already, no need for a generic always on superior version without any cost.

\section{Design Notes}
\begin{multicols}{2}[Loose ramblings on design notes and rationales used to justify the conversions follow here.]
\subsection{Regeneration and Uneducated power level}
At first glance, the ability to have near infinite wounds and strain is hard to balance. Some limitations were needed and just like the source material, regeneration can't be used to fuel spellcasting or adept powers. Regeneration is valued to be worth excess of 50 xp and that is why the Uneducated (p. \pageref{uneducated}) drawback is so big. To not make it just a drawback at character creation it was made to act like a skill tax of sort to try keep shapeshifters in line from low to high XP.

At higher xp levels healing, strain and criticals are not considered an issue outside combat. With the \textbf{heal} spell able to recover both wounds and strain, including all but 2 of the strain used to cast the last instance of the spell there is no reason to overvalue \textbf{Regenration} for any group of Player Characters that want to sustain a lot of damage. Add to that the 15 extra wounds per day gained from \textit{slap patches} and large amounts of strain recovered from \textit{stim patches} in a pinch the regeneration power is not outshining classical Medicine or healing magic by any stretch of the imagination.

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
I tried  here to give them some kind of place, but the playability limitations of being essentiallly a pidgeon-holed Rigger that is never with the team is a tough one. Design wise it is a terrible character concept and frankly A.I. have never been very playable as player characters. It is much easier to fit an infected character in a runner team than one that is worse than the Brawn 1 rigger that refuses to leave his Soak 20 car and never joins the team...

\subsection{Pixies?}
Just nope; if godlike stats on a tiny invisible creature with a .50 BMG anti material rifle that a 2ft pixie somehow can use without penalty floats your boat have at it. I can't care less that your 8 agility, reaction and 7+ in \textbf{ALL} mental stats race doesn't fit in. The Pixie Genesys equivalent statline of Brawn 1, Agility 3, Cunning 3, Logic 3, Willpower 3 and Presence 3, flying invisible, astral perception archetype is too expensive, sorry!

\subsection{Changelings}
Furry eh? Jokes aside, I'm working on it, but with the vast amount of combinations possible it might be a character archetype that requires a lot of moving parts for what ultimately becomes somewhat minor effects in the end. Changelings are supposed to be the victims of the '64 comet, not the ultimate optimization option. For cosmetic and minor effects it is probably a much better path to take to make a \textbf{Human} character with animal looks. Some things like \textit{low-light vision} or \textit{natural weapons} could be traded for some animal related drawback. Keep in mind though that we try to minimize the circus freak equivalents of Shadowrun's \textit{negative qualitues} lists. 

\subsection{Spending  Advantage and Threat only once}
Talents like \textbf{Master} and other ways to recovery Strain suggest that rolling 4-5 \Advantage\ and getting an instant refill on Strain is not intended. The same goes for threat. Nemesis enemies with \textit{Advesary} can just cash in on threat and advantage to knock out PCs. Even more importantly, Genesys offers so much better and more interesting ways to handle structured encounters if the \textit{First Order Optimization} of either tossing handfuls of \BoostDie\ around or having near infinite Strain to spend are discouraged. 

Why cause a critical with some unreliable debuff to the boss when \mbox{\BoostDie \BoostDie \BoostDie \BoostDie \BoostDie} given to your damage dealer will oneshot anything and never miss?
