This is Surukai's expansion on things not (currently) present in the Chaithi Shadowrun Genesys Conversion but might be useful for other Shadowrun conversions as well.

For more information on the base Genesys Shadowrun conversion, see \url{https://shadowrun.gamergadgets.net}. \index{Chaithi}

The purpose of this document is to add/suggest new features and parts in addition to add items used for the \textit{Boston Lockdown} campaign book.

\chapter{New Archetypes}
The new archetypes here are based on the metavariants, metasapients and others found in \textbf{Run Faster} for Shadowrun 5th edition or \textbf{Runner's Companion} (Shadowrun 4). Some updates of abilities are taken from Shadowrun 6th edition like Vampire being vulnerable to wood instead of silver.

\section{Metasapients}
\label{sec:metasapients}
Metasapients\index{Metasapients} are all non-metahumans and can generally not benefit from cyberware or bioware unless they are of exceptionally high quality and customization. Some metasapients are awakened and cannot become technomancers.

\section{Shapeshifters}
\label{sec:shapeshifters}\index{Shapeshifter}
\begin{multicols}{2}
Shapeshifters are awakened animals that can shift into a human form. They are animals and return to their natural form if killed or knocked unconscious. 

Common for all shapeshifters is their ability to regenerate from wounds and a vulnerability to silver. Other abilities granted from their animal side are generally only active while in their natural form. Some abilities like low-light vision can be used in their human for as well.

Gear and carried items do not transform and like other non-metahumans they can not benefit from cyberware or bioware. At the GM's discretion some highly specialised deltaware implants could work while they are in human form but operating on a creature that regenerates is at least daunting (\DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie).

Lacking education means they have a harder time mastering skills but some talents can reduce this.

All shapeshifters are awakened and cannot become technomancers.


\begin{description}
	\item[Regeneration]\index{Regeneration} At the start of every turn during structured encounters roll an Average (\DifficultyDie \DifficultyDie) \emph{Resilience} check; recover 1 Wound for every net \Success and 1 strain per \Advantage. A \Triumph recovers 1 critical, starting with the lowest severity. Wounds or strain suffered from activating magic or magical powers, from damage caused by silver weapons, or from social skills do not regenerate this way.
	\item[Shift]\index{Shift} As an Action, the shapeshifter can shift between their animal and human form. While in animal form they gain +1 Brawn and +1 Agility or +1 Agility and the ability to fly if their animal form is capable of flying.
	\item[Uneducated] \label{uneducated} After character creation, Shapeshifers pay XP for raising skills as if they all were non-career skills. Upgrade the difficulty when dealing with technology (or at the GM's discretion) unless the character has skill ranks in the relevant skill.

\end{description}

\section{Design Notes}
\begin{multicols}{2}[Loose ramblings on design notes and rationales used to justify the conversions follow here.]
\subsection{Regeneration and Uneducated power level}
At first glance, the ability to have near infinite wounds and strain is hard to balance. Some limitations were needed and just like the source material, regeneration can't be used to fuel spellcasting or adept powers. Regeneration is valued to be worth excess of 50 xp and that is why the Uneducated (\ref{uneducated}) drawback is so big. To not make it just a drawback at character creation it was made to act like a skill tax of sort to try keep shapeshifters in line from low to high XP.

At higher xp levels healing, strain and criticals are not considered an issue outside combat. With the \textbf{heal} spell able to recover both wounds and strain, including all but 2 of the strain used to cast the last instance of the spell there is no reason to overvalue \textbf{Regenration} for any group of Player Characters that want to sustain a lot of damage. Add to that the 15 extra wounds per day gained from \textit{slap patches} and large amounts of strain recovered from \textit{stim patches} in a pinch the regeneration power is not outshining classical Medicine or healing magic by any stretch of the imagination.

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
I tried  here to give them some kind of place, but the playability limitations of being essentiallly a pidgeon-holed Rigger that is never with the team is a tough one. Design wise it is a terrible character concept and frankly A.I. have never been very playable as player characters. It is much easier to fit an infected character in a runner team than one that is worse than the Brawn 1 rigger that refuses to leave his Soak 20 car and never joins the team...

\subsection{Pixies?}
Just nope; if godlike stats on a tiny invisible creature with a .50 BMG anti material rifle that a 2ft pixie somehow can use without penalty floats your boat have at it. I can't care less that your 8 agility, reaction and 7+ in \textbf{ALL} mental stats race doesn't fit in. The Pixie Genesys equivalent statline of Brawn 1, Agility 3, Cunning 3, Logic 3, Willpower 3 and Presence 3, flying invisible, astral perception archetype is too expensive, sorry!

\subsection{Changelings}
Furry eh? Jokes aside, I'm working on it, but with the vast amount of combinations possible it might be a character archetype that requires a lot of moving parts for what ultimately becomes somewhat minor effects in the end. Changelings are supposed to be the victims of the '64 comet, not the ultimate optimization option. For cosmetic and minor effects it is probably a much better path to take to make a \textbf{Human} character with animal looks. Some things like \textit{low-light vision} or \textit{natural weapons} could be traded for some animal related drawback. Keep in mind though that we try to minimize the circus freak equivalents of Shadowrun's \textit{negative qualitues} lists.
